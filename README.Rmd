## Introduction

This R package contains code used for testing which cell types can explain the heritability signal from GWAS summary statistics. The method was described in our [2018 Nature Genetics paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0129-5). 

This package takes GWAS summary statistics + single-cell transcriptome specificity data (in [EWCE](https://github.com/NathanSkene/EWCE)'s CellTypeData format) as input. It then calculates and returns the enrichment between the GWAS trait and the cell-types. 

## Installation

### R

Install `MAGMA.Celltyping` as follows:

```R
if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("`r repo`")
library(`r pkg`)
```

### MAGMA 

`MAGMA.Celltyping` now installs the command line software MAGMA automatically
when you first use a function that relies on [MAGMA](https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/magma) (e.g. `celltype_associations_pipeline`). 
If you prefer, you can later install other versions of MAGMA with:

```R
MAGMA.Celltyping::install_magma(desired_version="<version>",
                                update = TRUE)
```

## Using older versions

With the release of `MAGMA_Celltyping` 2.0 in January 2022, there have been a number of [major updates and bug fixes](https://github.com/neurogenomics/MAGMA_Celltyping/pull/93). 

- Only R>4.0.0 is supported. To use this package with older versions of R, install with:`remotes::install_github("neurogenomics/MAGMA_Celltyping@01a9e53")` 

## Bugs/fixes

Having trouble? Search the [Issues](https://github.com/neurogenomics/MAGMA_Celltyping/issues) 
or submit a new one.

Want to contribute new features/fixes? [Pull Requests](https://github.com/neurogenomics/MAGMA_Celltyping/pulls) are welcomed!

Both are most welcome, we want the package to be easy to use for everyone!
